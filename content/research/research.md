<div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto;">
<p style="font-size:1rem;">We are interested in employing in situ TEM combined with advanced techniques, such as 4D-STEM to address fundamental questions concerning the dynamic and collective response of structural and function components under their real-world conditions.  </p>


<h2 style="font-size:25px;"><strong>1.	Structural Materials for Fusion Reactors</strong></h2>
<p> We expect in situ TEM can be a powerful tool to study the failure mechanism of structural materials under irradiation, high temperature gradient, high pressure conditions in fusion reactor, which represents the most extreme operating condition for materials ever envisioned.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:25px;"><strong>2.	Failure analysis for solid state battery</strong></h2>
<p>We develop advanced and robust Cryo-EM techniques for battery. As both Li metal and its solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are chemically reactive and sensitive to electron-beam irradiation, high-resolution observation is difficult to perform at native environment.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:25px;"><strong>3.	AI for Science</strong></h2>
<p>We are interested in apply various AI-based techniques to push the boundary of scientific discovery in wide range engineering systems. These will involve computer-aided high throughput image analysis, integrated electron microscopy method and nature langurage process.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:25px;"><strong>4.	Extreme manufacturing</strong></h2>
<p>We seek to uncover the underneath physics across multi-scale and develop novel manufacturing process such as thermomechanical molding and additive manufacturing to obtain structural mateirals with unique functions.</p>
