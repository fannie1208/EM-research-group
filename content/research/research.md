<p>Utilizing electron microscope, we correlate structural behaviors to their macroscopic physical properties in matters - spanning a wide class of systems includes nuclear fusion reactor, advanced manufacturing and next-generation solid state lithium-ion battery. </p>


<p>Currently, we are interested in employing in situ TEM and Deep Learning-based computer vision to address fundamental questions concerning the dynamic and collective response of structural and function components under their operation conditions.</p>

<p>Students and researchers in the lab work at the intersection of nuclear materials, mechanical engineering, electron microscopy, and data science.</p>

<h2>Degradation mechanism in nuclear fusion reactor</h2>
<ul>
 <li> We believe fusion reactor to be a particularly rich source of not only clean energy but also unanswered scientific questions. Ranging from the first wall regions to the superconducting magnet of a fusion system represent arguably the most extreme operating condition (high temperature gradient, irradiation damage, corrosive environment) for materials ever envisioned.</li>
 <li> Therefore, a thorough understanding of their degradation mechanism under the operation conditions is essential to ensure structural integrity and lifetime prediction of the fusion reactor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extreme manufacturing</h2>
<ul>
 <li>We aim to understand and design novel processing routes to obtain high performance alloys for structural applications.
 <li>Emerging techniques including thermomechanical molding and additive manufacturing present an opportunity to tailor the microstructures of engineering alloys to obtain desired mechanical properties under elevated temperatures and irradiation.</li>
 <li>We seek to uncover the underneath physics and mechanic at multi-scale to optimize the manufacturing process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development of new electron microscopy methods and instrumentation</h2>
<ul>
 <li> We are interested in develop various electron microscopy techniques to push the boundary of scientific discovery in wide range engineering systems including solid state lithium-ion battery and organic polymer. </li>
 <li> These will involve computer-aided high throughput image analysis for four dimentional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) and hardware development for in situ electron microscopy.</li>
</ul>
