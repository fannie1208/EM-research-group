abstract: 
Structural materials used in nuclear power plants (NPPs) often suffer from irradiation induced damage, such as swelling, hardening, and embrittlement, due to the existence of defects such as bubbles, voids, and dislocation loops. In particular for the fusion reactor, the plasma-facing components of nuclear fusion reactors will need to withstand even higher fluxes of helium ions with energies up to several thousand electronvolts. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of these degradations is crucial for the development of radiation resistance materials for operation in such a harsh environment. Metallic glasses (MGs) as one class of amorphous materials that lack apparent defects such as grain boundaries and dislocation have exhibited superior mechanical performance in hardness, wear, toughness, strength, and corrosion resistance when compared to their crystalline counterparts with similar compositions. Moreover …
