abstract: Aluminum-based quasicrystals typically form across narrow composition ranges within binary to quaternary alloys, which makes their fabrication and characterization challenging. Here, we use combinatorial approaches together with fast characterization techniques to study a wide compositional range including known quasicrystal forming compositions. Specifically, we use magnetron co-sputtering to fabricate libraries of ~140 Al-Cu-Fe and ~300 Al-Cu-Fe-Cr alloys. The alloys compositions are measured through automated energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Phase formation and thermal stability are investigated for different thermal processing conditions (as-sputtered and annealed at 400 °C, 520 °C and 600 °C for Al-Cu-Fe libraries; annealed at 600 °C for Al-Cu-Fe-Cr libraries) using automated X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. In both systems the compositional regions across which …
