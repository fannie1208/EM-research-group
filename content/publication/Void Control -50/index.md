abstract: Techniques for void reduction in phase change memory (PCM) devices are provided. In one embodiment, the system is provided that comprises a PCM device comprising a first electrode and a second electrode. The system can further comprise a first connector coupled to the first electrode and that applies a negative voltage to the first electrode, and a second connector coupled to the second electrode and that applies a ground voltage to the second electrode, wherein applying the negative voltage to the first electrode and applying the ground voltage to the second electrode comprises negatively biasing the PCM device. The system can further comprise the first connector applying the positive voltage to the first electrode, and the second connector applying a ground voltage to the second electrode, wherein applying the positive voltage to the first electrode and applying the ground voltage to the second electrode …
