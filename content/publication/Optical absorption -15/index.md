abstract: We report the dependence of optical absorption on Sr concentration in La 1− x Sr x FeO 3 (LSFO)(⁠ x≤ 0.4⁠) perovskite thin films. Strained epitaxial films were deposited on SrTiO 3 substrates using oxide molecular beam epitaxy. We find systematic changes in the optical absorption spectra with increasing x including a red-shift of transition energies and the increasing presence of a lower energy transition within the fundamental gap of pure LaFeO 3⁠. These results serve as a demonstration of the complex manner in which absorption spectra can be altered in complex oxides via heterovalent A-site substitution.
