abstract: Recent renewed interest in layered transition metal dichalcogenides stems from the exotic electronic phases predicted and observed in the single- and few-layer limit. Realizing these electronic phases requires preserving the desired transport properties down to a monolayer, which is challenging. Surface oxides are known to impart Fermi level pinning or degrade the mobility on a number of different systems, including transition metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus. Semimetallic WTe2 exhibits large magnetoresistance due to electron–hole compensation; thus, Fermi level pinning in thin WTe2 flakes could break the electron–hole balance and suppress the large magnetoresistance. We show that WTe2 develops an ∼2 nm thick amorphous surface oxide, which shifts the Fermi level by ∼300 meV at the WTe2 surface. We also observe a dramatic suppression of the magnetoresistance for thin flakes. However …
