abstract: 
The effect of thermal oxide layer on He implanted 316L stainless steel was studied to evaluate experimentally how thermal oxidation affects the diffusion and distribution of He in the material. In the case of thermal oxidation of a He implanted sample, with an increase in oxidation time, the max swelling height increases logarithmically as a function of time and finally saturates for all samples except for the lowest dose of implanted He. Concerning TEM results, two void regions are identified. Similar to the calculation, the total irradiated depth was around 250 nm and the large void region was formed around 100–150 nm depth. On the other hand, the small void region was observed immediately under oxide layer from the thermal oxidation. In contrast, there were no voids in the altered zone near the metal/oxide interface in the non-thermal oxidized/He implanted sample. This description of the phenomena was justified …
