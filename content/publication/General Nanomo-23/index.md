abstract: Large-scale, controlled fabrication of ordered phases is challenging at the nanoscale, yet highly demanded as their well-ordered structure and chemistry is the key for advanced functionality. Here, we demonstrate a general nanomolding process of ordered phases based on atomic diffusion. Resulting nanowires are single crystals and maintain their composition and structure throughout their length, which we explain by a self-ordering process originating from their narrow Gibbs free energy. The versatility, control, and precision of this thermomechanical nanomolding method of ordered phases provides new insights into single crystal growth and suggest itself as a technology to enable wide spread usage for nanoscale and quantum devices.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
