abstract: 
Topological crystalline insulator (TCI) SnTe has attracted growing interest due to its promise for spintronics and quantum computing applications. Because the topological protection stems from the crystal symmetry for TCIs, crystal defects on the surface of SnTe can strongly influence the topological phases and transport properties. The goal of this work is, therefore, to unveil the origin and evolution of surface defects, such as pits, open cores and steps, observed on SnTe microcrystals and nanostructures synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We find that surface pits originate from different types of dislocations in SnTe crystals. Enlarging, deepening, and faceting of surface pits occur by sublimation of open cores and movement of steps during the cooling process of the CVD growth. In contrast, open cores and steps on surfaces form during growth. Surface crystal symmetry, surface polarization and growth …
