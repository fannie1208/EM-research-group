abstract: 
For decades, the role of crystallization has motivated research into crystal nucleation and growth. Since the development of thermodynamic frame work by Gibbs in late-1800s at Yale University, many studies in natural or synthetic systems have interpreted the crystallization results through the lens of classical nucleation theory and the terrace-ledge-kink model of crystal growth, both of which are based on monomer-by-monomer addition of simple chemical species. Despite the successes of classical nucleation and growth models in pharmaceutical, metallurgy, biomedical industries, there are a number of phenomena associated with crystal formation that cannot satisfactorily be explained or predicted by the classical models either quantitively and qualitatively. For example, meta-stable amorphous calcium carbonate precursors unexpectedly assist the calcite growth and a colossal crystallization rate is recently …
