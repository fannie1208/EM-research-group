abstract: While the synthesis of ABO3 perovskite films has enabled new strategies to control the functionality of this material class, the chemistries that have been realized in thin film form constitute only a fraction of those accessible to bulk chemists. Here, we report the synthesis of oxyfluoride films, where the incorporation of F may provide a new means to tune physical properties in thin films by modifying electronic structure. Fluorination is achieved by spin coating a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) solution onto oxygen-deficient films. The film/polymer bilayer is then annealed, promoting the diffusion of F into the film. We have used this method to synthesize SrFeO3-αFγ films, as confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
