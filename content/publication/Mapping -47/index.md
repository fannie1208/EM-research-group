abstract: 
Moiré superlattices are twisted bilayer materials, in which the long-range superlattice potentials from interlayer interactions can create quantum confinement in each layer. The quantum confinement can slow down or localize electrons in moiré superlattices, providing a tunable platform for studying strongly correlated physics1–4, such as superconductivity5–8, Mott insulators9, and interacting topological insulators10, 11. Previously, moiré superlattices were built exclusively using materials with weak van der Waals interactions12 and fabrication of moiré superlattices with strong interlayer chemical bonding (eg, covalent, metavalent, or ionic bonding) was considered to be impractical13. Here using lead sulfide (PbS) as an example, we report a strategy for synthesizing moiré superlattices coupled by strong metavalent bonding. We use water-soluble ligands as a removable template to obtain free-standing ultra-thin PbS nanosheets and assemble them into direct-contact bilayers with various twist angles. Atomic-resolution imaging shows the interlayer distance is approximately equal to the Pb–S bond length, rendering a strong metavalent coupling. Spatial mapping by electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals a strong localization of electronic states in small-angle twisted bilayers, which agrees with our DFT calculations. This study opens a new door to exploration of deep energy modulations within moiré superlattices alternative to van der Waals twistronics.
