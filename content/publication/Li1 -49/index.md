abstract: 
A solid-state rechargeable 3D microbattery is provided that has improved power density, energy density, and cycle lifetimes. These improvements are afforded by providing a solid-state electrolyte that is composed of crystalline Li 1+ x Al x Ti 2− x (PO 4) 3, wherein x is from 0 to 2. The solid-state electrolyte that is composed of crystalline Li 1+ x Al x Ti 2− x (PO 4) has a high ionic conductivity (which is greater than 10− 4 Siemens/cm) as well as high chemical stability.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
