abstract: 
The effect of Te concentration in molten FLiNaK salt on the corrosion and mechanical properties of 304 stainless steel was investigated. The corrosion depth of samples after the immersion tests for 48 h at 600 ℃ decreased with increasing Te concentration. Likewise, the sample after the immersion test containing 1.0 wt% of Te (1.0 wt% Te sample) showed less reduction in mechanical properties than the 0.1 wt% Te sample. We hypothesize that the condition for a Cr-oxide layer that has the protective property is fulfilled underneath the Ni-Fe rich layer which is formed by the selective leaching of Cr.
