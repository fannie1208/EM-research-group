abstract: 
Moiré superlattices are twisted bilayer materials in which the tunable interlayer quantum confinement offers access to new physics and novel device functionalities. Previously, moiré superlattices were built exclusively using materials with weak van der Waals interactions, and synthesizing moiré superlattices with strong interlayer chemical bonding was considered to be impractical. Here, using lead sulfide (PbS) as an example, we report a strategy for synthesizing moiré superlattices coupled by strong chemical bonding. We use water-soluble ligands as a removable template to obtain free-standing ultrathin PbS nanosheets and assemble them into direct-contact bilayers with various twist angles. Atomic-resolution imaging shows the moiré periodic structural reconstruction at the superlattice interface due to the strong metavalent coupling. Electron energy loss spectroscopy and theoretical calculations collectively …
