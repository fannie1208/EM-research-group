abstract: 
Phase change memories (PCMs) are non-volatile memory devices, which rely on the structural phase change of the active component for their operation: The resistance of the device is high when the active component is amorphous and it is low when the active component is crystalline. PCM is the leading memory technology to realize storage-class memory due to its non-volatility, fast switching, scalability, high endurance, and potential for multi-level cell operation [1]. Storage-class memory is expected to meet the growing memory demands stemming from the ever-growing computing power and the proliferation of data-intensive applications. In addition, an artificial neuron solely based on a PCM has recently been demonstrated, representing a breakthrough for neuromorphic computing [2].
