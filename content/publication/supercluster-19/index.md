abstract: While common growth models assume a structure-less liquid composed of atomic flow units, structural ordering has been shown in liquid metals. Here, we conduct in situ transmission electron microscopy crystallization experiments on metallic glass nanorods, and show that structural ordering strongly affects crystal growth and is controlled by nanorod thermal history. Direct visualization reveals structural ordering as densely populated small clusters in a nanorod heated from the glass state, and similar behavior is found in molecular dynamics simulations of model metallic glasses. At the same growth temperature, the asymmetry in growth rate for rods that are heated versus cooled decreases with nanorod diameter and vanishes for very small rods. We hypothesize that structural ordering enhances crystal growth, in contrast to assumptions from common growth models. The asymmetric growth rate is attributed to the …
