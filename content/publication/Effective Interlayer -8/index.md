abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) energy materials have shown the promising electrochemical characteristics for lithium ion storage. However, the decreased active surfaces and the sluggish charge/mass transport for beyond-lithium ion storage that has potential for large-scale energy storage systems, such as sodium or potassium ion storage, caused by the irreversible restacking of 2D materials during electrode processing remain a major challenge. Here we develop a general interlayer engineering strategy to address the above-mentioned challenges by using 2D ultrathin vanadyl phosphate (VOPO4) nanosheets as a model material for challenging sodium ion storage. Via controlled intercalation of organic molecules, such as triethylene glycol and tetrahydrofuran, the sodium ion transport in VOPO4 nanosheets has been significantly improved. In addition to advanced characterization including X-ray diffraction, high …
