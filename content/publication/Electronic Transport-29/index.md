abstract: 
We report on the electronic transport properties of epitaxial La1= 3Sr2= 3FeO3 films using temperature dependent resistivity, Hall effect, and magnetoresistance measurements. We show that the electronic phase transition, which occurs near 190K, results in a change in conduction mechanism from nonadiabatic polaron transport at high temperatures to resistivity behavior following a power law temperature dependence at low temperatures. The phase transition is also accompanied by an abrupt increase in apparent mobility and Hall coefficient below the critical temperature (T*). We argue that the exotic low temperature transport properties are a consequence of the unusually long-range periodicity of the antiferromagnetic ordering, which also couples to the electronic transport in the form of a negative magnetoresistance below T* and a sign reversal of the Hall coefficient at T*. By comparing films of differing …
