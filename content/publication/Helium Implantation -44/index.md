abstract: 
Microstructural changes induced by helium implantation in materials lead to volumetric swelling and mechanical property changes. How these properties are linked and establishing direct relationships can be difficult due to the underlying material’s microstructure evolution. Some materials also experience a phase change due to irradiation damage making them even more complex to analyze. Here, single crystalline Si (100) was used to establish a relationship among these parameters. The swelling height as a function of implantation fluence can equally fit a linear relationship. Solely irradiation induced defects are observed at low fluence below 5.0× 10 16 ions/cm 2. An abrupt amorphous and crystalline mixed layer of∼ 200 nm thick within a highly damaged polycrystalline matrix is observed when implantation fluence exceeds 5.0× 10 16 ions/cm 2, leading to the appearance of irradiation induced swelling and …
