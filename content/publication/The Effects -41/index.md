abstract: 
Ion beam implantations are widely performed to understand the effects of irradiation-induced displacement damage on nuclear structural materials. However, the volume of material that can be investigated is often limited by the maximum energies of accelerator facilitates, leading to a limitation in the thickness of samples whose mechanical properties can be evaluated. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s 88-Inch Cyclotron offers a wide range of ions and energies, allowing for material ion implantations at larger scales than typical. Four HT-9 SS-J-geometry tensile specimens were polished and then irradiated with deuterons at the 88-Inch Cyclotron to doses of approximately 0.2 dpa prior to small scale tensile testing. The results from this study show irradiation hardening characterized by the tensile test results and black dot irradiation defects. Additionally, a comprehensive look at low temperature …
