abstract: 
The embodiments described herein facilitate performing bipolar switching of a confined phase change memory (PCM) with a metallic liner, wherein the phase change memory and the metallic liner are located between a first electrode and a second electrode of a semiconductor structure, wherein a first voltage is applied to the first electrode while the second electrode is grounded, and wherein a second voltage is applied to the second electrode while the first electrode is grounded. The bipolar switching can be performed so as to produce a plurality of resistance states. Thus, this confined PCM can be utilized as a multi-level cell (MLC) memory.
