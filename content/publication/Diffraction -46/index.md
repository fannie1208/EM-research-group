abstract: 
The hidden structures in any organic materials govern their functional properties for wide range applications, including the organic electrolyte in Li-ion battery and kerogen as the source for hydrocarbon production through fracking. However, direct imaging of the structure in organic materials at the level of individual molecules has not been possible using conventional transmission electron microscope (TEM). This challenge is in part due to the highly electron beam sensitivity of organic liquid and their irregular arrangement of low Z contrast elements, ie, C, H and O. Despite the tremendous progress made in the past few years, imaging of organic materials are limited by: 1) the trade-off between detection range and spatial resolution, 2) the experimental condition set by the cryogen, ie, liquid nitrogen (77K) or Helium (2K) 1, 2, and 3) the lack of capability to combine with other in situ techniques, such as mechanical …
