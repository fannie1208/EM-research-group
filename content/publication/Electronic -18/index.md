abstract: The electronic phase diagram of epitaxial La1ÀxSrxFeO3 films is presented. The films were grown on SrTiO3 using molecular beam epitaxy with post-growth annealing to minimize oxygen vacancies. Insulating behavior is observed from x¼0–0.9, with metallic conduction only present for x¼1. 0. While the La-rich compounds exhibit polaron conduction over all temperatures measured, the Sr-rich films exhibit an electronic phase transition within the compositional window of x¼0. 49–0.9 as revealed by temperature-dependent resistivity measurements. The transition temperatures are found to decrease with increasing Sr content. The constructed phase diagram is discussed in the context of other 3d eg perovskite systems including manganites and cobaltites. VC 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.[http://dx. doi. org/10.1063/1.4893139]
