abstract: La 0.3 Sr 0.7 FeO 3-δ films undergo dramatic changes in electronic and optical properties due to reversible oxygen loss induced by low-temperature heating. This mechanism to control the functional properties may serve as a platform for new devices or sensors in which external stimuli are used to dynamically control the composition of complex oxide heterostructures.
